In this, we gained insight into the importance and inevitability of troubleshooting, and not to be disheartened but to keep learning and evolving your project.  She also mentioned the importance of having an uncomplicated reliable screen for our project. Moreover, she described a machine learning technique called fTMLDE for screening where only a minimal ratio of samples in the library needed to be assayed and sequenced. \nWe also described the issues we were having with mutagenesis with the Ag43 cleavage site and she suggested a technique called QuickChange PCR, which we later ordered primers for and attempted to implement. This highlighted the importance of tailoring our chosen mutagenesis method to suit our target site. For example, the cleavage site library consists only of two codons and we need only disrupt cleavage, thus almost any mutation at either site should be sufficient. \nWhen asking her about the practicalities of our project if it were upscaled, she advised us to consider the time and cost of our project on a larger scale. For example, we would need to consider what conditions are necessary for the bacteria and the PETase enzyme, and, even if we improved efficiency of the PETase enzyme by enhancing adhesion, would the time scale for breakdown be practical in the real world? \nOverall she agreed with us that our project doesn't have any ethical or social concerns for the wider public.

                ],
                fullTranscript: "As with many of our interviews, Benjamin brought up the importance of the screening process at the end of our project as he said it was the most crucial part. He asked about our controls especially, and suggested that as well as the wild type strain with either the Curli or Ag43 plasmid, we should have a control with an empty vector in it as well with the same ampicillin resistance for selection. We have since implemented this into our assay. \nRelated to this, he also mentioned the idea of picking a threshold value for our screen, whereby we only select those clones that go above this value. The threshold value would be determined by the controls. This will give us a small number of good clones to work with, which will be more time effective for the scope of our project. \nWe also spoke to Benjamin about the Fast and Flexible Synthesis of Combinatorial Libraries protocol and the problems that we were experiencing with it at the time as he said he had also used this before. He said from his experience of it, it is a very effective method once the PCR conditions are all perfected for each mutagenic primer and suggested that if we only had a small amount of megaprimer from the asymmetric PCR step, we can always PCR that up to get higher concentrations for the preparation of full length genes. \nWhen we asked Benjamin about if any communities would be negatively affected if our project was successful, he said the only one he could think of would be those who are currently working on a similar project but this typical of all research so is not a concern. \nBenjamin gave us lots of useful advice when we spoke to him about scaling up biotechnologies. He said when thinking about our project we need to be aware that we are only evolving the outer membrane proteins to stick to polystyrene, when in the real world plastics come in all different shapes, sizes and materials and can have different coatings and additives which provides a potential limitation to our project. Unfortunately we aren’t able to properly address this within the timescale and scope of our project but we hope that the data we produce can contribute to another group looking into this in the future.  He also described the different routes you can take once you have a potentially successful biotechnology in the lab. There is the possibility to publish this technology, but this comes at the cost of not being able to patent it. Alternatively you could patent it and make it into a business, which could bring monetary profit but running a business would become an intense full-time job.",
